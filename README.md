### Introduction
This repo contains my group's final project for the _Introduction to Statistics for Data Science_ class (W203) in UC Berkeley's Masters in Data Science program, from the Spring 2021 semester.

### Description

Using data from the New York Times' <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/COVID-19-data">Coronavirus (COVID-19) Data in the United States</a> and from the United States Census' <a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/programs-surveys/acs/about/ACS_Information_Guide.pdf">American Community Survey</a>, our report investigates the relationship between the poverty levels of a state and the impacts of the Coronavirus pandemic, using data from early 2020.
